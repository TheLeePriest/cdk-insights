    "This resource has potential security issues due to its wide permissions. It allows unrestricted access to any Amazon S3 resource.",
    "This resource has a dependency on another resource, \"CustomVpcRestrictDefaultSGCustomResourceProviderRole26592FE0\". This could potentially introduce a dependency cycle if the resource is used in multiple stacks. It's important to ensure that the dependency is properly managed to avoid any issues.",
    "The CloudFormation resource includes a Lambda function with a high memory configuration (2048 MB). While larger memory sizes can be beneficial in certain scenarios, it is important to ensure that the increased memory allocation does not lead to excessive resource consumption or negatively impact the performance of the function or the overall application. Additionally, it is recommended to review the function's code and configuration to ensure that it is optimized for efficiency and avoids unnecessary resource usage."
